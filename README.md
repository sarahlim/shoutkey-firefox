# shoutkey-firefox

Adds a button to the Firefox toolbar to quickly generate a [ShoutKey](http://shoutkey.com) for the current page. A ShoutKey is a one-word, easy-to-pronounce URL with 5-minute lifetime (when generated through this extension).

Working on Firefox 57 and newer. This extension is not affiliated with ShoutKey.
