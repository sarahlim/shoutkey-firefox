# yellkey-firefox

Adds a button to the Firefox toolbar to quickly generate a [YellKey](http://yellkey.com) for the current page. A YellKey is a one-word, easy-to-pronounce URL with 5-minute lifetime (when generated through this extension).

Working on Firefox 57 and newer.

YellKey is inspired by ShoutKey, which was closed down around January 2018.

Download and install from [addons.mozilla.org](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/shoutkey/).
